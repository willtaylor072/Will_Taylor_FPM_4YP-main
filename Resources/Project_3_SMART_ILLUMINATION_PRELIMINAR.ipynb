    "# PROJECT 3: SMART ILLUMINATION - PRELIMINARY\n",
    "In this project, you will investigate the use of an LED array to generate multiple imaging modalities using the same microscope. Contrast generation is one of the key aspects of microscopy that enables useful images to be acquired. Contrast can be generated by employing a number of different illumination techniques. A custom-addressable diode array allows flexible control of sample illumination and can therefore be used to enhance contrast in a number of ways."

    "### Introduction to Image Processing with Fourier Transform and Bandpass Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will introduce you to basic concepts in image processing, specifically focusing on the Fourier Transform and the application of a bandpass filter. Understanding these concepts will enhance your ability to analyze and manipulate images in the frequency domain, which can be particularly useful in various fields such as signal processing, medical imaging, and computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Representation:**\n",
    "   - Digital images are represented as matrices of pixel values. Each pixel value corresponds to the intensity of light at that point in the image. For grayscale images, these values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grayscale Conversion:**\n",
    "   - Converting an image to grayscale simplifies processing by reducing the image to a single channel. This is often a preliminary step in image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fourier Transform:**\n",
    "   - The Fourier Transform is a mathematical tool that transforms an image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. It decomposes the image into its sinusoidal components, allowing analysis of the image's frequency characteristics.\n",
    "   - The 2D Fourier Transform is used for images, providing a frequency representation where low frequencies are concentrated at the center and high frequencies are towards the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Magnitude Spectrum:**\n",
    "   - The magnitude spectrum represents the amplitude of different frequency components. It is often visualized using a logarithmic scale to handle the wide range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bandpass Filtering:**\n",
    "   - A bandpass filter allows frequencies within a certain range to pass through while attenuating frequencies outside this range. This is useful for removing noise or isolating specific features in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Inverse Fourier Transform:**\n",
    "   - To convert the filtered frequency representation back to the spatial domain, the Inverse Fourier Transform is applied. This reconstructs the image from its frequency components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What the Code Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Convert Image:**\n",
    "   - The image is loaded and converted to grayscale using the `load_image` function. This simplifies the data to a 2D array of pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Fourier Transform:**\n",
    "   - The `compute_fourier_transform` function computes the 2D Fourier Transform of the grayscale image, shifts the zero frequency component to the center, and calculates the magnitude spectrum for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply Bandpass Filter:**\n",
    "   - The `apply_bandpass_filter` function creates a mask to filter out frequencies outside the specified range (low and high cutoff frequencies) and applies this mask to the shifted Fourier Transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualize Results:**\n",
    "   - The `plot_images` function displays the original image, its Fourier Transform, the filtered image, and the Fourier Transform of the filtered image. This provides a clear comparison of the effects of the bandpass filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `PIL`.\n",
    "- Set the path to your image and define the low and high cutoff frequencies.\n",
    "- Run the code to load the image, compute and apply the Fourier Transform and bandpass filter, and visualize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process highlights how frequency domain analysis can be used to filter and enhance images, providing powerful tools for various image processing applications."
