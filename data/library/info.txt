v2 microscope:
usaf_red
* 2.5s exposure red light

usaf_v2
* 0.8s exposure white light no ambient light at all (should be the best one)

No set of parameters worked well for reconstruction...

v1 microscope:
usaf_v1 optimised parameters for reconstruction

LED2SAMPLE = 55 # Distance from LED array to the sample, 80mm (larger distance leads to closer overlapping Fourier circles)
LED_P = 3.3 # LED pitch, 3.3mm
NA = 0.105 # Objective numerical aperture, 0.1
PIX_SIZE = 1050e-9 # Pixel size on object plane, m, 1025nm for 3D printed microscope (directly measured)
WLENGTH = 550e-9 # Central wavelength of LED light, m, 550nm for white, 630nm for red, 460nm for blue
x_initial = -2.83 # x distance from first LED to optical axis, mm (+ve if first LED is to right of optical axis)
y_initial = -3.39 # y distance from first LED to optical axis, mm (+ve if first LED is below optical axis)
