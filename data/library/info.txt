Most reconstructions done with the following algorithm parameters:
options = {
    'max_iter': 8, # Number of iterations
    'alpha': 1, # Regularisation parameter for object update, <10
    'beta': 1, # Regularisation parameter for pupil update, >1
    'plot_mode': 3, # 0, off; 2, plot every image; 3, plot every iteration (notebook version)
    'LED_correction': 0, # 0, off; 1, accurate; 2, fast. Update wavevectors during reconstruction 
    'update_method': 2, #Â 1, PIE; 2, ePIE; 3, rPIE
    'momentum': False, # Use momentum on alpha and beta (tuned for ePIE only)
    'intensity_correction': True, 
}


cardiac_muscle, lilium_anther, rectum, saliva, talia_stem, zea_root all taken with LED2SAMPLE = 50mm
talia_stem_2 has LED2SAMPLE = 71mm
pixel size = 3450/3 = 1150um

#####
Adjustment to V3 microscope

talia_65_new and talia_50_new are taken with V3 microscope with 4x magnification,
with the reference geometry for the objective (20mm working distance and 160mm tube length)
so the pixel size is 3450/4=863um
exposure 500ms and green light

With 4x magnification system increase exposure slightly 

usaf_v3_NEW
600ms green, 4x magnification, 50mm LED2SAMPLE

usaf_v3_NEW_2
800ms exposure

diamond samples:
600ms green, 4x magnification, 50mm LED2SAMPLE

diamond_1 is the ~600nm slanted lines - no darkfield info... cannot reconstruct
diamond_2 is the ~2um center to center lines
diamond_3 is the ~1um center to center lines
diamond_4 is dots of decreasing separation
