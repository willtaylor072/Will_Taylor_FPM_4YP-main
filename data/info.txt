Parameters for old tests:
* cheap objective focussed directly onto camera sensor
* camera is sc0715 global shutter raspberry pi camera
* NA = 0.1, system magnification = 4 for tube length = 160mm
* pixel size on object plane = 862.5nm (3.45um sensor pixel / 4x magnification)
* LED to sample: 54mm
* sample to objective: 24mm
* objective to sensor: 160mm
* images taken in spiral sequence, take first n^2 images for an nxn reconstruction
* both usaf target data sets are for the positive target

After the 3D printed version is built the following has changed:
* since the tube length is now only 120mm (fixed by length of metal bars)
the magnification is not the same. By measuring pixel size with known USAF geometry,
each pixel on the object plane is about 1.1um (so magnification is 3.14 - lower than before)
* everything else is the same

Specific data information:
* usaf_new, 300ms exposure, 300x300
